Reference for writing any document an agent consumes: a skill, an `AGENTS.md`
or `CLAUDE.md`, a doc reached by a pointer. The packaging differs; the writing
does not. The same levers make each one predictable, meaning the agent takes
the same process every run, not that it produces the same output.

When the document you are writing is a skill, read
[`SKILL-MECHANICS.md`](SKILL-MECHANICS.md) for frontmatter, invocation choice,
and router skills.

## In this repo

- Every skill carries the `metadata` block the installer reads: `harness`
  (`claude`, `codex`, default both), `platform` (`win32`, `linux`,
  `darwin`; a general skill lists all three), `scope` (`fleet` here; a
  private repo with the same layout uses it to mark skills bound to one
  machine), and `requires` when the skill needs something the installer does not set up.
  A skill works under both harnesses unless `harness` says otherwise, so
  nothing in it may depend on a tool only one of them has without naming the
  fallback.
- A skill adapted from elsewhere keeps a `license:` line in its frontmatter
  and the source's notice in `LICENSE.txt` next to it.
- Three house rules apply inside every skill here: no em dashes, en dashes
  or arrows; mock-first for visual work; no destructive action the user did
  not ask for. `frontend-design` is the one exception, copied verbatim from
  upstream.
- A skill in this repo names no machine, person or company. Those belong in
  the user's private instructions; a skill says "the user" and reads the
  rest from there.
- Leading words stay. The `unslop` skill's plain-word rules are for prose
  people read; a document for an agent keeps its _frontier_, _relentless_ and
  _idempotent_.

## Context pointers

A **context pointer** is a reference held in the agent's context that names
some out-of-context material and encodes the condition for reaching it. A
skill's description is one; a line in `AGENTS.md` naming a doc is the same
object. The pointer's wording, not its target, decides when the agent reaches
the material, and how reliably. A must-have target behind a weakly worded
pointer is a variance bug: sharpen the wording first, and inline the material
only if sharpening fails.

A pointer does two jobs: state what the material is, and list the
**branches** that should trigger reaching it (a branch is a distinct case the
document handles, so different runs take different paths through it). Every
word of an always-loaded pointer costs on every turn, so it earns even harder
pruning than the body:

- **Front-load the leading word.** The pointer is where it does its triggering
  work.
- **One trigger per branch.** Synonyms that rename a single branch are one
  branch written twice; collapse them and keep only genuinely distinct
  branches.
- **Cut identity the body already carries.**

## The two loads

Every document and pointer you add spends one of two budgets:

- **Context load.** The cost of always-loaded material on the agent's window:
  an `AGENTS.md` line, a skill description, anything sitting in context every
  turn, spending tokens and attention whether or not it fires.
- **Cognitive load.** The cost on the human: which documents exist and when to
  reach for each. The human is the index. Not a cost to minimise; it is the
  price of human agency. Spend it where human judgement matters, remove it
  where it does not.

Material reached only through a pointer escapes context load at the price of
the pointer's own line; material with no pointer at all rides entirely on
cognitive load.

## Information hierarchy

A document is built from two content types, **steps** (the ordered actions
the agent performs) and **reference** (definitions, rules, facts consulted on
demand), and they mix freely: all steps (a recipe), all reference (a review's
rules, this skill), or both. The core decision is where each piece sits on the
**information hierarchy**, a ladder ranked by how immediately the agent needs
the material:

1. **In-file step.** The primary tier: what the agent does, in order.
2. **In-file reference.** Consulted on demand. Often a legitimately flat
   peer-set (every rule of a review on one rung), which is a fine arrangement,
   not a smell.
3. **Disclosed reference.** Pushed out into a separate file, reached by a
   context pointer, loaded only when the pointer fires. Spans a sibling file
   in the same folder through fully external reference that lives anywhere
   and any document can point at.

Push too little down and the top bloats; push too much and you hide material
the agent actually needs. That tension is the whole decision.

**Progressive disclosure** is the move down the ladder, out of the main file
and behind a pointer, so the top stays legible. Not primarily a token
optimisation: it is how the hierarchy is protected. Branching is the cleanest
disclosure test: inline what every branch needs, and push behind a pointer
what only some branches reach. When a document has steps, in-file reference
that should be disclosed buries them and turns attending to them into a
coin-flip, a variance lever, not just a legibility one.

**Co-location** is the within-file companion: where the ladder decides how
far down a piece sits, co-location decides what sits beside it once there.
Keep a concept's definition, rules, and caveats under one heading rather than
scattered, so reading one part brings its neighbours with it. The test: the
document should read like documentation written for the agent. Grouped
material reads that way; scattered material does not. (Distinct from
duplication: that repeats one meaning in two places; scattering fragments one
meaning across many.)

**Sprawl** is the failure mode here: a document simply too long, even when
every line is live and unique. Attention thins across the excess, and every
extra line is one more to keep relevant. The cure is the ladder: disclose
reference behind pointers, and split by branch or sequence so each path
carries only what it needs.

## Steps and completion criteria

Every step ends on a **completion criterion**, the condition that tells the
agent the work is done. Two properties make it a lever:

- **Clarity.** Can the agent tell done from not-done? A vague bound
  ("understanding reached") invites **premature completion**: ending the step
  before it is genuinely done, attention slipping to being done. The visible
  steps still ahead, the **post-completion steps**, supply the pull; the
  criterion's clarity is the resistance. Defend in order: **sharpen the bound
  first** (local and cheap); only if it is irreducibly fuzzy and you observe
  the rush, hide the later steps by splitting the sequence. Hiding only works
  across a real context boundary (a hand-off or a subagent dispatch; an inline
  call leaves the later steps in context and clears nothing).
- **Demand.** How much it requires. "Every modified model accounted for"
  forces thorough work where "produce a change list" does not. Demand drives
  **legwork**, the digging the agent does within the work, latent in the
  wording rather than written as its own step. It is not step-bound: "every
  rule applied" binds a body of flat reference just as "every step done"
  binds a sequence, which is how an all-reference document still carries an
  exhaustiveness bar.

The strongest criteria are both checkable and exhaustive.

## When to split

Splitting one document into two spends one of the two loads, so split only
when the cut earns it:

- **By sequence.** Split a run of steps where the post-completion steps tempt
  the agent to rush the one in front of it. Keeping them out of view drives
  more legwork on the current task. Beware the reverse: merging sequences
  exposes each step's later steps to what follows, inviting premature
  completion.
- **By invocation.** Skill-specific: see
  [`SKILL-MECHANICS.md`](SKILL-MECHANICS.md).

## Leading words

A **leading word** is a compact concept already living in the model's
pretraining that the agent thinks with while running the document (_lesson_,
_fog of war_, _tracer bullets_). Repeated as a token, never as a sentence, it
accumulates a distributed definition and anchors a whole region of behaviour
in the fewest tokens, by recruiting priors the model already holds. Coining
your own works if you define it clearly, but a made-up word recruits no
priors: you pay in definition tokens what a pretrained word gives free. Reach
for an existing word first.

It anchors twice. In the body, execution: the agent reaches for the same
behaviour every time the word appears, and inside flat reference it focuses
attention on a class of thing to look for. In a pointer, invocation: when the
same word lives in your prompts, your docs, and your codebase, the agent links
that shared language to the material and reaches it more reliably.

Hunt for opportunities to refactor with leading words. A triad spelled out at
three sites, a pointer spending a sentence to gesture at one idea: each is a
passage begging to collapse into a single token.

- "fast, deterministic, low-overhead" becomes _tight_ (a _tight_ loop).
- "a loop you believe in" becomes _red_: a fuzzy gate becomes a binary
  observable state (the loop goes _red_ on the bug, or it doesn't).

You win twice: fewer tokens, and a sharper hook for the agent to hang its
thinking on. Assume every document is carrying restatements that leading
words retire, and go find them.

**Negation** is the failure mode beside this lever: steering by prohibition
drags the forbidden behaviour into context and makes it more available, not
less. Don't think of an elephant, and the elephant is all there is; the
negation is a weak modifier the strongly-activated concept overruns, so the
ban half-reads as an instruction to do the thing. Prompt the **positive**:
state the target behaviour ("write one-line comments") so the banned one is
never spoken. A prohibition earns its place only as a hard guardrail you
cannot phrase positively; even then, pair it with the positive target so
attention lands on what to do.

## Pruning

- Keep each meaning in a **single source of truth**: one authoritative place,
  so changing the behaviour is a one-place edit. **Duplication**, the same
  meaning in more than one place, costs maintenance and tokens, and inflates a
  meaning's prominence on the ladder past its real rank. (The accidental
  inverse of a leading word, which repeats a token on purpose, never the
  meaning.)
- The **environment** is a source of truth too: `package.json` scripts,
  config files, the directory layout, `--help` output. A document that
  restates it is a **cache**, a copy of a lookup, earning its load only when
  the lookup is expensive. Cache what the agent cannot find by looking: the
  unwritten convention, the reason behind a choice, the gotcha no config
  confesses. Leave the one-file, one-command lookups to the environment,
  where they cannot go stale.
- Check every line for **relevance**: does it still bear on what the document
  does? A line loses relevance by never bearing on the task (mere exposition,
  or a branch that should be disclosed) or by going stale as the behaviour or
  world it describes changes. Shorter documents are easier to keep relevant.
  Without a pruning discipline the default fate is **sediment**: stale layers
  that settle because adding feels safe and removing feels risky, until you
  must core down through them to find what is still live.
- Hunt **no-ops** sentence by sentence: an instruction the model already
  obeys by default pays load to say nothing. The test, does it change
  behaviour versus the default, is model-relative, not reader-relative: two
  people disagreeing about a no-op disagree about the default, and settle it
  by running the document, not by debate. When a sentence fails, delete the
  whole sentence rather than trim words from it. The test also grades leading
  words: a word too weak to beat the default (_be thorough_ when the agent is
  already thorough-ish) is a no-op, and the fix is a stronger word
  (_relentless_), not a different technique.
